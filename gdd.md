# Taken Idea
We pick, a shoot'em up as first level so we have something to show then we can change to runner/obstacle, platformer, etc

- we can move in x & y direction on the whole screen
- we can shoot
- (later) we can pick shoot direction

## Shmup ideas
Enemies are invisible unless lighten.
- One weapon that kills
- One weapon that lights around it
- A bomb that lights the whole screen for $x$ seconds
